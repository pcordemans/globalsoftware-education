# Global Software Development projects in Education

[Key-Action 2 Strategic partnerships in the field of education, training and youth - Erasmus+](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/programme-guide/part-b/three-key-actions/key-action-2/strategic-partnerships-field-education-training-youth_en )

## Research project

> How can students build up experience with global software development and process management?

## Current state of global software development

Software is no longer developed in a single physical location. Outsourcing, offshoring are examples, but also open-source software is inherently not tied to a single place. With multiple locations, collaboration between developers becomes distributed, distant and asynchronous. These issues require special measures and arrangements. Also when developing software in multiple countries language and cultural barriers might interfere as well.

However technical solutions exist to ease the process of global software development. In particular version management and software project management software as Github, collaboration hubs e.g. Slack and real-time communication technology as Skype are tools to overcome these challenges. These tools not withstanding, process management and developer attitude challenges remain.

These process management challenges include:

* Technical problems of communication
* Cultural differences
* Coordination
* Communication speed 
* Knowledge sharing
* Group awareness
* Heterogenenous teams
* Creativity
* Quality

## Multi-site project-based learning

We want to build international teams of student software developers, which tackle a complex problem without having physically meet eachother. Confronted with a technical challenge they should obtain first-hand experience with modern global software development and international collaboration. Students learn to collaborate / plan / coordinate / execute a software project. This should enhance their soft skills, learn modern collaboration tools and experience development methodologies such as Agile, Scrum, etc. Students will also learn how to present their work on the internet, managing a project website, wiki, providing installation instructions for demoonstration purposes, writing user manuals, etc.

## Partners

We are looking for university partners who will participate in the project and who will share their expertise.  

Our own expertise at VIVES university of applied sciences is with Internet of Things, [Mbed](https://mbed.com) and more specifically LoRaWAN technology.
